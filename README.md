Exploratory Data Analysis of a Covid-19 Dataset (source: https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths  last update: 28/06/2022)

**Motivation**: I recently recovered from Covid and decided to finally check out a dataset to see what insights I can build from the data using SQL.

SQL Environment: Microsoft SQL Server Managment Studio (T-SQL)

## Importing Data
1. Create a database in SSMS
2. Open SQL Server Import and Export Wizard
3. Choose Microsoft Excel as data source and select Excel file
4. Choose SQL Server Native Client <version_no> as destination and select created database.
5. Select copy data from one or more tables or views
6. Select sheet containing relevant data
7. Click next to import data and finish
